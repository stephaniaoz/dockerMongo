The CONCORD program established worldwide surveillance of population-based cancer survival in 2015, analyzing individual data on 26 million patients (including 10 million US patients) diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common malignancies. METHODS: In this Cancer supplement, we analyzed data from 37 state cancer registries that participated in the second cycle of the CONCORD program (CONCORD-2), covering approximately 80% of the US population. Data quality checks were performed in 3 consecutive phases: protocol adherence, exclusions, and editorial checks. One-, 3-, and 5-year age-standardized net survival was estimated using the Pohar Perme estimator and state- and race-specific life tables of all-cause mortality for each year. The cohort approach was adopted for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, and the complete approach for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Articles in this supplement report population coverage, data quality indicators, and age-standardized 5-year net survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. Examples of tables, bar charts, and funnel plots are provided in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of services in providing equitable health care. The high quality of US cancer registry data, 80% population coverage, and use of an unbiased net survival estimator ensure that the survival trends reported in this supplement are robustly comparable by race and state. The results can be used by policymakers to identify and address inequities in cancer survival in each state and for the United States nationally. Cancer 2017;123:4982-93. Published 2017.

There is a need to identify biomarkers for effectiveness of drugs beside the biomarkers for the diseases like cancer to advance the field personalized medicine. We have used a panel of cancer cell lines from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) to capture the sensitivity of drugs. By combining the genetic information such as mutations, copy number variations and gene expression levels from Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and The Cancer Genome ATLAS (TCGA) for the afore mentioned cell lines, we are able to identify genomic features associated with the sensitivity of the drugs. © 2017 IEEE.|association analysis; biomarkers; cancer; drug sensitivity; genomics; statistical analysis|Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Cell culture; Cosmology; Gene expression; Sensitivity analysis; Statistical methods; Anti-cancer therapies; Association analysis; cancer; Copy number variations; Drug sensitivity; Gene expression levels; Genomics; Personalized medicines; Diseases|Williams, P., Lee, J., Theodorescu, D., Genomancy: Predicting tumour response to cancer therapy based on the oracle of genetics (2009) Curr Oncol, 16 (1), pp. 56-58; Costello, J.C., Heiser, L.M., Georgii, E., Gonen, M., Menden, M.P., Wang, N.J., Bansal, M., Mpindi, J.-P., A community effort to assess and improve drug sensitivity prediction algorithms (2014) Nature Biotechnology, 32 (12), pp. 1202-1212; Iorio, F., Knijnenburg, T.A., Vis, D.J., Bignell, G.R., Menden, M.P., Schubert, M., Aben, N., Lightfoot, H., A landscape of pharmacogenomic interactions in cancer (2016) Cell, 166 (3), pp. 740-754; Yang, W., Soares, J., Greninger, P., Edelman, E.J., Lightfoot, H., Forbes, S., Bindal, N., Thompson, I.R., Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC): A resource for therapeutic biomarker discovery in cancer cells (2013) Nucleic Acids Research, 41 (D1), pp. D955-D961; Garnett, M.J., Edelman, E.J., Heidorn, S.J., Greenman, C.D., Dastur, A., Lau, K.W., Greninger, P., Soares, J., Systematic identification of genomic markers of drug sensitivity in cancer cells (2012) Nature, 483 (7391), pp. 570-575; Forbes, S.A., Beare, D., Gunasekaran, P., Leung, K., Bindal, N., Boutselakis, H., Ding, M., Ward, S., COSMIC: Exploring the world's knowledge of somatic mutations in human cancer (2015) Nucleic Acids Research, 43 (D1), pp. D805-D811; Lawrence, M.S., Stojanov, P., Polak, P., Kryukov, G.V., Cibulskis, K., Sivachenko, A., Carter, S.L., Roberts, S.A., Mutational heterogeneity in cancer and the search for new cancer-associated genes (2013) Nature, 499 (7457), pp. 214-218; Gelman, A., Scaling regression inputs by dividing by two standard deviations (2008) Statistics in Medicine, 27 (15), pp. 2865-2873; Torgo, L., Torgo, L., (2011) Data Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies, , USA: Chapman &Hall/CRC Boca Raton, FL; Ullah, E., Rawi, R., (2016) Bastah: Big Data Statistical Analysis for High-Dimensional Models, , https://CRAN.Rproject.org/package=bastah, R package version 1.0.7|'|Yoo I.Zheng J.H.Gong Y.Hu X.T.Shyu C.-R.Bromberg Y.Gao J.Korkin D.|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.|'|9781509030491|'|'|English|Proc. - IEEE Int.

The timing of pubertal growth—as measured by age at menarche and age at attained height—may also influence risk. We evaluated associations of adult height, age at attained height, and age at menarche with incidence of invasive breast cancer in 55,687 African American women in the prospective Black Women's Health Study. Over 20 years, 1,826 invasive breast cancers [1,015 estrogen receptor (ER) positive; 542 ER negative] accrued. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with breast cancer overall and by ER status, mutually adjusted for the three factors of interest. Adult height was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer (HR for ≥70 inches vs ≤63 inches: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.89) but not ER− (corresponding HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.71) (p heterogeneity = 0.34). HRs for attained height before age 13 versus age >17 were 1.30 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.76) for ER+ and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.96) for ER− breast cancer. Results for age at menarche (≤11 vs ≥14 years) were similar for ER+ and ER− breast cancer (HR for breast cancer overall: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.50). We confirmed height as a strong risk factor for ER+ breast cancer in African American women and identified early age at attained height as a risk factor for both ER+ and ER− breast cancer, albeit without statistical significance of the latter associations. While adult height and timing of pubertal growth are inter-related, our findings suggest that they may be independent risk factors for breast cancer. © 2017 UICC|African American; breast cancer; epidemiology; height; pubertal growth; risk|estrogen receptor; estrogen receptor; adult; African American; age; aged; Article; body height; cancer incidence; cancer risk; estrogen receptor negative breast cancer; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; growth; human; major clinical study; menarche; priority journal; proportional hazards model; puberty; risk factor; Breast Neoplasms; ethnology; incidence; menarche; metabolism; middle aged; prospective study; young adult; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Body Height; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Menarche; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Receptors, Estrogen; Risk Factors; Young Adult|Colditz, G.A., Frazier, A.L., Models of breast cancer show that risk is set by events of early life: prevention efforts must shift focus (1995) Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 4, pp. 567-571; Russo, J., Tay, L.K., Russo, I.H., Differentiation of the mammary gland and susceptibility to carcinogenesis (1982) Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2, pp. 5-73; Ma, H., Bernstein, L., Pike, M.C., Reproductive factors and breast cancer risk according to joint estrogen and progesterone receptor status: a meta-analysis of epidemiological studies (2006) Breast Cancer Res, 8, p.

The strong influence of hormones and reproductive factors on ovarian cancer suggests that endocrine disruptors may impact lifetime risk. Exposure to pesticides and other environmental agents may also increase the risk of ovarian cancer, but these studies are limited in number. Experimental models are of crucial importance to understand the biological and genetic factors that influence cancer development and to determine which environmental factors have an impact upon tumorigenic processes. Rodent models reflect very well the biology and histological appearance of a subset of human ovarian tumor types, notably the germ cell, sex cord-stromal and granulosa cell tumors; however, rodents do not spontaneously develop epithelial cancers that resemble human epithelial ovarian cancer, the most common type. Recent developments in genetically engineered models better reflect the potential for epithelial ovarian cancers to originate in the ovarian or fallopian tube (oviductal) epithelium. This article summarizes the wide range of spontaneous, experimentally derived, and genetically modified rodent models of ovarian tumors. Continuing improvements that enhance their clinical relevance will increase the value of these model systems for the assessment of environmental and toxicological agents that may impact ovarian cancer risk. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.|Epithelial ovarian cancer;
